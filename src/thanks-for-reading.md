## **🙏 Thanks for Reading**

**Thanks for reading :P**

Mucha gratitude if you made it this far.
This guide is an ongoing effort and I keep adding to it from time to time, so it never really will be finished :o
Whenever I feel I understand a concept better than I did the day before, it’ll expand — and sometimes I’ll try make it look more concise & readable.

It does help me, but I would also hate to think the effort in this guide went mostly to waste given the late release, in a dwindling community.
So do feel free to check on it whenever you want and give any support or constructive feedback in the comments section.

So why are you still here? **Weirdo.**
Well, I may as well give one more link — here’s a video of a KF Speedmapper?, in a timelapse:

See if you can spot some of the features you may have learned along the way — how you could plan, or maybe upscale some of his building methods.
It’s a great example for planning, although nobody cares if it’s scribbles. With a ruler and more effort, you can accurately envision a plan with usable dimensions.

Anyway, maybe I’ll catch you around town :o
