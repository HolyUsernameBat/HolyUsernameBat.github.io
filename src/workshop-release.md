## 🧰 **Workshop Release**

It couldn’t be more simple — navigate to **Tools → Upload files to Steam Workshop**.

![Workshop Tools Screenshot](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/35405394/KFToolsList.jpg)

Since everyone *should* have the same Killing Floor file directories, the workshop will only upload files that are inside your **Killing Floor** folder, and it will install them into other players’ folders *exactly where it found yours*.

^
For example: if you accidentally put a `.rom` file in the **Textures** folder, the workshop might install it into another player’s **Textures** folder too.
And no one will play your map because — **you stink.**

💡 **ProTip:**
The description box during upload has a strict *character limit*.
But once your item is uploaded, you can freely **edit the description on Steam Workshop** to format it however you like — bold text, sections, emojis — all that fancy stuff.

But first…

### *Do you Stink?*

If you tick *every single tag* when uploading something simple, you **definitely stink**.
Tags are meant to make the workshop easier to navigate — but for KF, they’re basically pointless now.
There’s no moderation for lying tags, so everyone stinks, nobody browses properly, and it sure won’t help your views in the long run.

### *Template*

Don’t underestimate your upload formatting — it’s the **main advertisement** for your map.
If you consider yourself semi-experienced, setting a good standard helps others follow suit (unlike 90% of Steam content creators 😏).

Even if you don’t upload a video, feel free to borrow from [this template](https://insultingpros.github.io/LazyKFWiki/#/Workshop/Workshop_Tmpl) or the version below (credits to the [doofus](https://steamcommunity.com/id/NikC-/)):

 [h1][b]General Information[/b][/h1]
This remake fixes some nasty original map [b][i]features[/i][/b].
[spoiler]for more info spam comments section[/spoiler]
[list]
[*] Patriarch's spawn in tested, delayed intervals (usually as pairs).
[*] Built-in voteable Hard Mode.
[*] Amounts of dosh given feels more balanced.
[*] There's a second level, with planks, cover and all your wildest dreams.
[*] Additional armour and high tier weapon pickups (with consistent spawn % for all difficulties).
[*] Scripted pipe bombs near blocked off Patty spawns.
[*] Addressed zed pathing issues.
[*] And more fun additions such as a replacement for the siren wave.
[/list]


[h1][b]Whitelist Status[/b][/h1]
[list]
[*] Dedicated server: all clients will level up, get achievs.
[*] Listened server: all clients will level up, get achievs.
[*] Solo: (and you guessed it) Still whitelisted.
[/list]


[h1][b]Technical Information[/b][/h1]
① This is simply a map, no embedded mutators or whatever. To edit/remove pipe bombs search for the tag "PipeSpawner" in the actor class browser and delete or navigate to the scripted triggers -> AI Script.
② 'SkipWave' event command will skip to next trader (but use at own risk on normal mode).
③ The optional Hard Mode features pat spawns without timed intervals, for the classic BossArena experience.
④ Pat spawns are storymap style, so if the probability works out (and you're a lucky bastard) you could have all of the patriarchs spawn in the same room.

## **🙏 Thanks for Reading**

**Thanks for reading :P**

Mucha gratitude if you made it this far.
This guide is an ongoing effort and I keep adding to it from time to time, so it never really will be finished :o
Whenever I feel I understand a concept better than I did the day before, it’ll expand — and sometimes I’ll try make it look more concise & readable.

It does help me, but I would also hate to think the effort in this guide went mostly to waste given the late release, in a dwindling community.
So do feel free to check on it whenever you want and give any support or constructive feedback in the comments section.

So why are you still here? **Weirdo.**
Well, I may as well give one more link — here’s a video of a KF Speedmapper?, in a timelapse:

[▶ YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLspWWx3Qos&feature=youtu.be)

See if you can spot some of the features you may have learned along the way — how you could plan, or maybe upscale some of his building methods.
It’s a great example for planning, although nobody cares if it’s scribbles. With a ruler and more effort, you can accurately envision a plan with usable dimensions.

Anyway, maybe I’ll catch you around town :o
